    "\n",
    "    a. This function applies a discrete wavelet transform to an image using the Haar wavelet.\n",
    "    b. It returns the coefficients of the transform, which include the approximation coefficients (cA) and the detailed coefficients in horizontal (cH), vertical (cV), and diagonal (cD) orientations.\n",

    "    a. A similarity matrix is constructed to compare frames across videos.\n",
